# Music Collection Manager (MCM)

### 1. Introduction
The Music Collection Manager (MCM) is a standalone, offline application designed for DJs, music producers, and music enthusiasts who manage large offline music libraries. Unlike standard music player applications, MCM focuses on organization, searchability, and similarity analysis, providing users with an advanced and highly customizable tool to catalog and manage their music collections efficiently.

Many existing music players or cataloging tools are either too simplistic for professionals or too dependent on internet access, requiring cloud-based solutions that may not be ideal for DJs and producers who rely on offline collections. MCM is built to bridge this gap, allowing users to catalog their music with detailed metadata, find tracks based on various criteria, and even analyze song similarities to assist with set preparation, remixing, and playlist curation.

With MCM, users can assign detailed attributes to each track, such as title, artist, album, genre, BPM (beats per minute), key, release year, and custom tags. This level of detail enables advanced search, filtering, and organization that standard music players do not provide. The application also offers tools to analyze songs based on their tempo, key, and musical characteristics, helping DJs and producers quickly find songs that mix well together or fit a particular mood or theme.

Since MCM works entirely offline, users maintain full control over their collections without relying on cloud storage, streaming services, or internet connectivity. This makes it an ideal solution for professionals who need fast and reliable access to their music files, whether in a live performance setting, a studio session, or simply for personal organization.

### 2. Core Features
